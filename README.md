# Portfolio

![visitor badge](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=aleph-discord-bot.visitor-badge)

This is my debut project utilizing Next.js, a portfolio website featuring four primary sections: Home, About, Projects, and Contact. The site is brought to life with animations powered by Framer Motion, enhanced page transitions with Fullpage.js, and styled using elements of Tailwind CSS. This project also read list of project data from a JSON file. It serves as a showcase of my web development skills and represents my initial foray into web development with Next.js.
